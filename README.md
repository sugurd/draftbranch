# DRAFTBRANCH

Please note, that this is currently a draft project. That means,
the history on the 'draft' branch can be changed at any time without notifications.
Furthermore, the 'draft' branch will be deleted at some point in the future,
along with all its commits. You may use this branch for testing or experimentation, but
do not do any serious work here.

This project is an example that shows how to start
from a draft branch.
